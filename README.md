# Web-CourseWork

Travel Blog 

The purpose of this project is to give visitors a clear view of Uzbekistan and its cities. The website provides brief information about the country and its six most frequently visited regions (Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Fergana, Kashkadarya). Each page includes separate content with a short description and a public video for a better representation of a particular region. It also contains the names of the landmarks and their photographs. At the end of each page, there is a Google map to help users better navigate in the local area. The site also has a contact form in the navigation bar where the user can send a message for any reason. Moreover, foreign users of the site can find useful tips and recommendations before coming to Uzbekistan. There are 9 pages in total, 6 of them are regions, and the last 3 pages relate to the home page, contact, and regions page.
